# ABOUT ME
Hi, Welcome to my Blog. My Name is Saad Shahzad & i'm a Cyber Security Engineer by profession and a part time bug hunter.I graduated with my Bachelor's majoring in Computer Science in 2019 and i'm a security-geek (if that is a word :p). I became aware of this field in 2018 and have been working since then.
I have reported security vulnerabilities to some international companies like fanduel, NCSC UK and pentested on private projects. My Skills include Website Penetration Testing, Network Penetration Testing & Vulnerability Assessment. I am not a python ninja but i love to write scripts in python especially automation :).
