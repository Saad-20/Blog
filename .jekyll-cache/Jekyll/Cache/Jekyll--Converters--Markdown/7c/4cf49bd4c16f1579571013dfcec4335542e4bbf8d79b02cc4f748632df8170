</p>
<p>According to the room, it is described as where the hacker will practice their skills in web and privilige escalation.
So letâ€™s get Hacking :)</p>

<p><strong>TASK 1: Deploy The machine and connect to our network</strong></p>

<p>After Deploying the machine, The room will assign you an IP address to connect on. You also would require to have openvpn connection in order to connect to the server</p>

</p>

<p><strong>TASK 2: Find the services exposed by the machine</strong></p>

<p>After we have been assigned an IP address, let run nmap in order to find the network services it is running and what OS it is. I typically use the following nmap script</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nmap -A -p- -T5 --script vuln 10.10.89.26 -vv</code></p>

  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Saad-20/Blog/master/assets/Basic_Pentesting_Images/3.OPEN_PORTS.png" />
</p>

<p>From the First Screenshot, we saw the following ports were opened: -</p>
<ol>
  <li>22</li>
  <li>80</li>
  <li>8080</li>
  <li>139</li>
  <li>445</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>TASK 3 What is the name of the hidden directory on the web-server?</strong></p>

<p>Looking at the nmap result, port 80 seems to be open.Opening the IP address in the browser, we see that the website is under maintenance. Nothing interesting here.</p>
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Saad-20/Blog/master/assets/Basic_Pentesting_Images/6.Website_index.html.png" />
</p>

<p>Lets directory brute-force the website to see what directories it consists of i.e. in order to find interesting files and folders.<br />
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">python3 ~/tools/dirsearch/dirsearch.py -u http://10.10.89.26/ -e html,js,php,aspx,asp,txt,ini,db</code></p>
<p align="center">

</p>
<p>From the screenshot above, we found an interesting folder called development. Congratulations you found the hidden directory. 
Inside the development folder, there are two files hosted in the directory. They are: -</p>
<ol>
  <li>dev.txt</li>
  <li>j.txt</li>
</ol>
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Saad-20/Blog/master/assets/Basic_Pentesting_Images/7.Development_page.png" />
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Saad-20/Blog/master/assets/Basic_Pentesting_Images/8.dev.txt.png" />
  <img src="https://github.com/Saad-20/Blog/blob/master/assets/Basic_Pentesting_Images/9.j.txt.png" />
</p>
<p>By reading the dev.txt and j.txt file. We can assume the following information that would help us exploiting this machine. That is: -</p>
<ol>
  <li>there are two users j and k</li>
  <li>samba is configured</li>
  <li>J has a weak password policy</li>
</ol>

<p>Now lets enumerate samba by running the following script
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">enum4linux -a 10.10.89.26</code></p>

<p>Looking at the screenshot, we can safely enter the samba shares with the default username anonymous. The command for entering into smb shares is
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">smbclient //10.10.89.26/anonymous</code></p>

<p>Hmmmmâ€¦There is an interesting file called staff hosted. Lets download it into our local machine and see what it consists of. In order to download the file, we used the following command
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">smbget -R smb://10.10.89.26/anonymous</code></p>

<p><strong>TASK 4</strong>
By reading the staff.txt file, we found the two usernames kay and Jan. From our task 3, we did know that jan has a weak password policy. Lets brute-force his account first
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">hydra -t4 -l jan -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt 10.10.89.26 ssh</code></p>

<p><strong>TASK 5 &amp; 6. What is the username and password?</strong>
From the screenshot above, we found the password for jan. We can now use his credentials in order to enter his account</p>

<p><strong>TASK 7 What service do you use to access the server(answer in abbreviation in all caps)?</strong>
Lets use his password in order to connect using ssh since port 22 is open. The command for enter through ssh is
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ssh jan@10.10.89.26</code>
As you can from the screenshot we have successfully entered into jan account</p>
