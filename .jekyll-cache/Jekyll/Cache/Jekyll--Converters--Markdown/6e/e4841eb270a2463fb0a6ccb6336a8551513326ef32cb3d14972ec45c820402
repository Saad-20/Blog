<p><strong>TASK 1: Deploy The machine and connect to our network</strong></p>

<p>After Deploying the machine, The room will assign you an IP address to connect on. You also would require to have openvpn connection in order to connect to the server</p>

<p><strong>TASK 2: Find the services exposed by the machine</strong></p>

<p>After we have been assigned an IP address, let run nmap in order to find the network services it is running and what OS it is. I typically use the following nmap script</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nmap -A -p- -T5 --script vuln 10.10.89.26 -vv</code></p>
