According to the room, it is described as where the hacker will practice their skills in web and privilige escalation.

**TASK 1: Deploy The machine and connect to our network**

After Deploying the machine, The room will assign you an IP address to connect on. You also would require to have openvpn connection in order to connect to the server

**TASK 2: Find the services exposed by the machine**

After we have been assigned an IP address, let run nmap in order to find the network services it is running and what OS it is. I typically use the following nmap script

```nmap -A -p- -T5 --script vuln 10.10.89.26 -vv``
