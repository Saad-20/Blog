**What is GraphQL?**
GraphQL is a query language that allows to access data from the database via single API endpoint. As compared to REST API, where there are seperate endpoint for each calling the user makes. With GraphQL, we only need one endpoint to access all data.   
There are two operations in GraphQL API, they are: -   
1. Query   
2. Mutation   

Query is used to read data while mutation is used to modify data. You can learn more about GraphQL at this link ```https://graphql.org```
